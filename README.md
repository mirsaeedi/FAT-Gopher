# FAT-Gopher

FAT-Gopher is an old-fashioned Windows Forms application. It was a course project during my first year in university in 2008. I thought sharing its code would help others to satisfy their curiosity about FAT32 internals. Please don't suppose to face a very well-architecture source code, but I believe it's still really readable if you know one or two things about FAT32 Format.

If you want to go for a dip in FAT32, [Microsoft FAT32 Whitepaper](http://read.pudn.com/downloads77/ebook/294884/FAT32%20Spec%20%28SDA%20Contribution%29.pdf) is a must-read.
